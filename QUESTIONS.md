# Auto-Generated Questions/Prompts

## Add self-generated posts according to day of week (or list from School of dated questions provided)

### Every Thursday and Friday they have a discussion prompt/question:

Thursday: What is one thing you are thankful for?
Friday: What was your favorite thing we did at school this week?

So, on Wednesday at 3 AM (or whatever) a post should be auto-generated which displays something like "Thankful Thursday: What is one thing you are thankful for this week?" and a button for "Answer" -- when clicked, it takes the user to a form page where they can answer the question. The post generated is then put in the timeline as normal, and the "Question Post" is removed from the timeline automatically.

Same on Thursday at 3 AM (or whatever) for the prompt/question: Friday: What was your favorite thing we did at school this week?

### They also do Tell Us Tuesday and Would You Rather Wednesday with rotating questions: 

This is a bit more complicated because it's rotating questions. So, on Monday at 3 AM (or whatever) a post is auto-generated which displays something like "Tell Us Tuesday Topic: {question for that date}" and a button for "Answer" -- when clicked, it takes the user to a form page where they can answer the question. The post generated is then put in the timeline as normal, and the "Question Post" is removed from the timeline automatically.
